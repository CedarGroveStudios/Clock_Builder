# Clock_Builder
 
## An in-development collection of modules and libraries for building standalone RTC clocks.

Clock_Builder currently supports:

Real-time clock modules:
- Adafruit DS3231 RTC

Displays:
- CircuitPython REPL, including time setting function
- Adafruit 4-digit 7-segment single-color LED displays
- Adafruit 4-digit 14-segment single-color LED displays
- PyBadge and EdgeBadge DisplayIO-based TFT display, including time setting function

Future support is planned for OLED displays. Time setting devices will include PyGamer and generic support for rotary encoder and GPIO-connected buttons.

See the CedarGroveStudios/Unit_Converter repository for a compatible automatic North American Daylight Saving Time method.
